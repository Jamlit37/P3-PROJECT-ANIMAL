# P3-PROJECT-ANIMAL
## Description
A web application built for a business who is changing from a private volunteer wildlife shelter into a zoo, open to the public.
AS A user
I WANT TO be able to get ample information about the Zoo and shop/buy tickets 
SO THAT I can easily enjoy my purchases and have great knowledge of what I can expect from the Zoo

## Installation
In order to be able to run the app after being cloned you need to run, using node
```
npm install
```
Then to populate seed data and run it the application you can use
```
npm run seed
npm start
```
## Issues
All pages working on localhost but getting error "info:1 Refused to load the image 'data:image/png;base64,.....' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'none'". Note that 'img-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback."  As well as H10 code error on heroku portfolio page after working for like 10 seconds. No functionality in shopping area or ticket area.
